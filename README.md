# Geese71

This is the starter project for a rich JavaScript client using:

* React.js
* webpack

The project is designed for big-ish applications, i.e.

* Code and assets are grouped per application module (projects, people)
* Modules are loaded dynamically, the first time they are used

## To do

* Find a real client-side router that can plug into the dynamic load mechanism
* Setup a testing framework for TDD-ing

## Developing

npm install
npm start

## Building for production

webpack -p
